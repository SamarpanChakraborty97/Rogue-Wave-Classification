# Wave-Forecasting

## Content
This repository contains the codes for performing rogue wave forecasting using machine learning and deep learning techniques. Specifically, given a time window of wave data, the aim was to predict whether there will be a rogue wave over the horizon of the next few minutes. For this classification problem, LSTM, Decsion Trees, Support Vector Machine Classfier and Graph Neural Networks have been utilized.
